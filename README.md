Sure, here's an example readme file for your Django app:

# Class Management System (Django)

This is a web-based class management system built using the Django framework. It allows teachers to manage their classes and students, track attendance, and grade assignments. It also allows students to view their class schedules, submit assignments, and view their grades.

## Skills Learned

During the development of this app, the following skills were learned:

- Working with Django models to create a database schema.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system.
- Using Django's class-based views and URL routing to create a RESTful API.
- Building custom template tags and filters to display data in the user interface.
- Working with Django forms to handle user input.
- Creating custom management commands to perform administrative tasks.
- Writing unit tests to ensure application functionality.
- Using Git for version control and collaboration.


## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up for an account and log in to access the system.
- User roles: Different user roles are available (teacher, student, administrator), each with different levels of access.
- Class management: Teachers can create and manage classes, add students, and track attendance.
- Assignment grading: Teachers can grade assignments and enter grades into the system.
- Student portal: Students can view their class schedules, submit assignments, and view their grades.
- Administrative tools: Administrators can manage user accounts and roles, and view system usage statistics.
